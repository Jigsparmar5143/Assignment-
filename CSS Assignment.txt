Confusion Due to Its Many Levels:-
The programming language world is indeed complicated for non-developers and beginners. Moreover, different levels of CSS f.e. CSS; CSS 2; CSS 3 can be pretty confusing for most of the users.

In practice, it is often necessary to fix not only one CSS file but also HTML tags associated with CSS selectors. It sometimes significantly increases the editing time and testing as well.

Different Layout Display:-
If browsers are outdated, the same CSS data may be interpreted differently by them.

Vulnerability:-
If you have worked with CSS, you probably know that it is easily accessible because of its open text-based system.
